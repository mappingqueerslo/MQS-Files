    <p>Cuesta Squares is a gay square dancing club that has been running in SLO County since 1997. 
      It is a place for older members of the LGBTQ+ community to gather, exercise, and socialize as well as form bonds with college-aged dancers. 
      The club currently meets at 1580 Railroad Street in Oceano, the Central Coast Senior Citizens Center, but formerly met at a dance studio in downtown SLO. 
      They have been known to perform at pride events throughout the SLO County area and their caller Darren Gallina teaches through the Cal Poly Country Line Dancing Club.

      Square dancing originated as a pretty heteronormative discipline- with one partner dancing the “girl” part and the other dancing the “boy” part. 
      Despite this, there are a large number of gay square dancing clubs in the International Association of Gay Square Dance Clubs (IAGSDC) where 
      members of all sexual orientations and gender identities are free to dance whichever part they choose. Cuesta Squares is an inviting and inclusive 
      organization regardless of one's gender, sexuality, age, or background. They aim to teach people how to square dance as well as be a fun environment for socialization and dancing.
