        <p>The goal of Mapping Queer SLO (MQS) is to inform people in the San Luis Obispo area of the queer spaces that have existed—both past and present—in the area. 
            We hope this site allows you to learn about this important history in a way that is fun and rewarding instead of it being an arduous or boring task. 
            Queer history is a discipline built on collaboration and community — so we hope if you would like to join in this community you do.</p>

          Varenna Kay (pronouns she/her/hers) is a queer Liberal Arts & Engineering Studies major who created this project for her senior project at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
          Mapping Queer SLO is inspired by her work in a Queer Oral History course and her own and others' experiences being a queer person in a rural area like the Central Coast.
