    <p>
      Journey's Inn was the first gay bar in San Luis Obispo and was located at 2115 Broad Street. It is unclear what years the bar was operational, 
      but news articles about the bar from the SLO Telegram-Tribune and Mustang Daily date between 1976 and 1988. 
      The bar was a gathering place for gay and lesbian people from all over SLO County, but did not advertise itself publicly until the 80s
      for fear of discrimination. 
      It was also a popular destination for Cal Poly students due to its cheap deals on food and drinks.

    <p>
      There is not much public information available about the history of Journey's Inn, but from what is available
      the bar seemed to be a laid-back and casual place where queer people could meet and socialize with each other.
      There was also a large crowd of straight customers and college students, so it was really just a place to mingle,
      unwind, and have some cheap drinks and food.
