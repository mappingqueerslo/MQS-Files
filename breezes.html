      <subhead>Breezes was a gay bar in SLO from February 1992 to December 31, 1997. It was the most recent gay bar in Central Coast history and was the first to be openly LGBTQ+ centered. 
        The bar and restaurant was a place for adults in the queer community to meet, socialize, and unwind together.</subhead>
