  <p>The GALA Center is both an organization and a physical building that both work to support members of the LGBTQ+ community 
  throughout SLO City and County. The center is located at 1060 Palm Street in downtown SLO and serves as a hub for many queer 
  activities as well as a drop-in center for anyone looking for a safe place to be and someone to talk to. 
  They also specialize in community services like housing and healthcare, and have many other resources as well. 
  The organization has existed since 1997, and have been at their location since 2013.</p>
